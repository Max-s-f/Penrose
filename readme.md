## Penrose tiling

Fun little coding side project, was inspired by this [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34) so decided to implement it

Penrose.py makes a penrose tiling pattern using rhombi and kind of trapezium like shapes [example9.png]

Penrose-kites.py makes a penrose tiling pattern using kites and darts, and I think demonstrates 5 fold symmetry nicely
