## Penrose tiling

Fun little coding side project, was inspired by this [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34) so decided to implement it

Penrose.py makes a penrose tiling pattern using rhombi and kind of trapezium like shapes [see here](example9.png)

Penrose-kites.py makes a penrose tiling pattern using kites and darts, but doesn't quite work as I'd like it to 
[see here](example11.png)
